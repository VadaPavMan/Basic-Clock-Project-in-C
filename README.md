# Basic-Clock-Project-in-C
This repository contains two C programs that implement basic clock functionalities: a normal counting clock and a backward counting clock.

1. Normal Counting Clock
- Description:
This program simulates a basic digital clock that counts time in hours, minutes, and seconds. It starts from 00:00:00 and counts up continuously.

- Features:
Displays time in the format hh:mm:ss.
Updates every second.
Resets to 00:00:00 after reaching 23:59:59.

2. Backward Counting Clock
- Description:
This program simulates a countdown clock that starts from a specific time (e.g., 01:00:00) and counts down to 00:00:00.

- Features:
Displays time in the format hh:mm:ss.
Counts down every second.
Resets to 01:00:00 after reaching 00:00:00.

# Requirements
Compiler: GCC or any C compiler.
Libraries: Standard C libraries for time and I/O operations.
